Exercise 11

Q1. 
In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

A1.
I cached the DataFrame we got from calculating the average score for each subreddit. I also cached the DataFrame we got from calculating the max relative score for each subreddit.

If I didn't used .cache() anywhere, then the DataFrames would be destroyed and when I would try to access it again for other operations, it would need to be recalculated, so the running time would be longer.

Q2. 
How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

A2.
The broadcast was a bit shorter, so marking DataFrames for broadcast can reduce the running time of the "best author" program, but it was only by a few seconds.
